The washers must be placed between the screws and the mount, and their shape adjusts to the countersunk holes. The torque calculation for the adjustable side screws is 53-71 inch-pound force to 6-8 NM Newton Meters, and for the picatinny nuts, it is the same setup but with additional use of the washers with the Pard Screws. The mount is priced at €110,99 and is available for purchase with various payment options, including PayPal. The SKU for this product is IBP-165-FAP-008S, and it is in stock for immediate purchase.

The formulation of VIRALEZE™ provides a mucoadhesive formula that acts as a physical moisture barrier, hydrating the nasal mucosa to protect against mucosal drying and damage. This natural defense mechanism supports the body's natural defenses against viruses. The spray also contains astodrimer sodium, which is antiviral and has been shown in laboratory studies to physically trap and block respiratory viruses, thereby inactivating them. This irreversible interaction with the virus prevents it from infecting cells, and the trapped and blocked viruses are eliminated naturally through the nasal mucus. VIRALEZE™ Antiviral Nasal Spray is designed to offer a physical barrier to respiratory viruses, making it an effective solution for managing colds and flu.

This injection is designed for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (brain, spine, and surrounding tissues) and the body (head and neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and musculoskeletal system). The approved dose for Gadopiclenol Injection is 0.05 mmol/kg, which has been shown to improve the detection and visualization of lesions over unenhanced MRI alone and to provide similar diagnostic efficacy compared to 0.1 mmol/kg of the lower-relaxivity Gadobutrol injection. The product is highly stable and offers the highest relaxivity among gadolinium-based contrast agents available in the United States. The approval of Gadopiclenol Injection follows Priority Review, which is granted for products that are considered significant improvements in safety or effectiveness compared to standard options. The pivotal Phase III studies supporting the approval were designed as crossover studies, comparing MRI of the CNS or MRI of the body with 0.05 mmol/kg VUEWAY injection or unenhanced MRI alone, and 0.05 mmol/kg Gadopiclenol with 0.1 mmol/kg Gadobutrol in adult patients. The studies showed that MRI with Gadopiclenol was non-inferior to MRI with the full dose of Gadobutrol, with Gadopiclenol providing better quality visualization of lesions. No major safety signals were reported during the development of VUEWAY in either adult or pediatric patients, and the adverse events reported during the two Phase III studies were similar for both products administered. The product will be commercialized by Bracco under the brand name VUEWAY™ (gadopiclenol) injection and VUEWAY™ (gadopiclenol) Pharmacy Bulk Package. The strategic collaboration between Bracco and Guerbet in December 2021 resulted in the commercialization of the product independently under different brand names. The collaboration is expected to accelerate access to Gadopiclenol and deliver innovation, better care to patients and caregivers alike.",Gadobenate Dimeglumine Contrast Agent,[{'Name': 'None'}],MultiHance,['Healthcare'],"['Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system, body']",False,[None],"[{'quantity': 0, 'time_frame': None, 'type': None, 'unit': None}]","[{'amount': 0, 'currency': None, 'type': None}]",[None],['Gadobenate DimeglumineGadobenate Dimeglumine'],[None],-1,[None],['Available for pediatric patients aged 2 years and older'],[None],[None],"[{'dimension': None, 'qualitative': False, 'type': None, 'unit': None, 'value': None}]","[{'original': None, 'simple': None}]","[{'qualitative': False, 'type': None, 'unit': None, 'value': None}]",False,"[{'qualitative': False, 'type': None, 'unit': None, 'value': None}]","[{'qualitative': False, 'type': None, 'unit': None, 'value': None}]",[None],['High relaxivityIncreased r1-relaxivity relative to macrocyclic GBCAsDesigned for use in clinical settings where diagnostic information is essential'],"""Gadobenate Dimeglumine Contrast Agent"" is a gadolinium-based contrast agent approved for diagnostic MRI of the liver in both adult and pediatric patients aged two years and older.

The primary ingredient in Silver Leaf is colloidal silver, which is present at a concentration of 500 mg/l. This product is specifically formulated to enhance the effectiveness of plant protection products and fertilizers by improving the characteristics of the working solution and enhancing the effect of applied pesticides and agrochemicals. It activates the natural immunity of plants, thereby preventing diseases and promoting growth. The unique composition of Silver Leaf ensures better penetration of plant protection products into the plant, increases the plant treatment area, and ensures better penetration of products into the plant. This results in higher yield and quality of agricultural products due to the complete assimilation of macro- and microelements by the plant when used together with foliar fertilizers. Additionally, Silver Leaf reduces the cost of chemical treatments by decreasing the consumption rates of preparations for a working solution. It promotes the rapid penetration of systemic preparations into plants through the stomatal apparatus of the plant and exhibits enhanced action and effectiveness of fungicides in difficult applications. The spray layer on plants becomes more resistant to precipitation, and it is highly efficient in spraying together with a complex of preparations for a tank mixture. The mechanism of action of Silver Leaf is to promote the rapid penetration of active ingredients of pesticides and fertilizers into the leaf surface of plants, multiply the fungicidal effect when used together with fungicides, and trigger nonspecific immunity. The product is applicable to various crops, including field and industrial crops, vegetable crops, fruit crops, and ornamental crops. The consumption rate of Silver Leaf varies depending on the crop and the type of product used, ranging from 0.1-0.2 liters per hectare for fungicides, insecticides, and fertilizers, to 100-300 liters per hectare for other products. The water consumption also varies, with the highest consumption rates for fungicides, insecticides, and fertilizers at 200-400 liters per hectare, and the lowest at 200-500 liters per hectare for other products. Overall, Silver Leaf is a versatile and effective product designed to enhance the health and productivity of various agricultural crops through its unique formulation and high efficacy.",Concentrated Liquid Fungicide,['Product_Code: 7735830'],Andersons,['Lawn & LandscapeHorticultureGolf CoursesResidential LawnsCommercial LawnsSpecialty CropsRow CropsNurseriesOrnamentalsSports Fields'],['Controlling Fungal DiseasesControlling Weeds'],False,[None],"[{'quantity': 0, 'time_frame': None, 'type': None, 'unit': None}]","[{'amount': 0, 'currency': None, 'type': None}]",[None],['Fenoxaprop-P-Ethyl'],[None],-1,[None],[None],['Bags'],[None],"[{'dimension': 'Volume', 'qualitative': False, 'type': 'min', 'unit': 'gal', 'value': '2'}

These slides feature a one-side extension and an S-shaped design, which provides a high degree of sturdiness and stability. The GN 2406 model is constructed from heat-treated steel, which includes a zinc plating and blue passivation for enhanced durability and resistance to environmental factors. The raceways of the rails and runners are hardened, ensuring long service life and reduced wear. The balls used in these slides are made from anti-friction bearing steel, which is also hardened for added durability. The ball cage is also made of steel and is zinc plated for added protection. The intermediate metal sheet of the ball cage and the ball cage itself are also steel and zinc plated, contributing to the overall robustness and longevity of the slides. The GN 2406 telescopic linear slides are designed to be linked by an intermediate profile, making them ideal for applications where lateral space requires a small width and large extension is needed. The rails and the intermediate profile are of equal length, allowing for an extension that is longer than the base length. External elements are designed to limit the maximum sliding distance, and the supports of the rail are engineered to prevent the inadvertent extraction of the runner from the rail. These slides are available in various lengths, ranging from 130 mm to 1970 mm, and can be customized to meet specific requirements. The load rating for these slides varies depending on the model, with values ranging from 587 to 4755 Co rad in N. The GN 2406 telescopic linear slides are typically adjusted to create a clearance-free match-up between the rail and the runner, and the raceways of the rails and runners are induction hardened to further reduce wear and extend the service life. The slides are permanently lubricated with a high-grade special grease designed for linear guide rail systems, ensuring smooth operation and minimal maintenance. The standard mounting hardware for these slides is DIN 7991-10.9 countersunk head screws, which should be mounted with the recommended tightening torque. The slides are designed to handle traversal speeds of up to 0.8 m/s, although the specific application and installation length can affect this value. The GN 2406 telescopic linear slides are suitable for various industrial environments where higher load ratings, quiet operation, and long service life are required.

These cam rollers are engineered to provide precise and smooth linear motion, making them ideal for applications requiring high accuracy and reliability. The GN 2426 model features a roller with a bore, categorized as Type B, and is constructed with anti-friction bearing steel that is hardened for enhanced durability. The rollers are dust and splash water protected, ensuring long service life and superior performance under various conditions. They are permanently lubricated, which contributes to their longevity and smooth operation. The sealing disc used in these rollers is made of plastic NBR, and the bearing pivot is steel zinc plated and blue passivated, providing robust protection against wear and corrosion. The GN 2426 cam rollers are designed to work seamlessly with cam roller linear guide rails, such as the GN 2422, to form comprehensive linear guide rail systems. These systems are known for their low-maintenance operation, long service life, and quiet running, making them suitable for facilities with low energy requirements. The rollers are available in different configurations, including normal rollers with a centered bearing mounting point (Type N) and eccentric rollers with an eccentric bearing mounting point (Type E). The cam rollers are also compatible with floating bearing rails (Type UT or UV), which provide clearance freedom or initial tension adjustments during assembly. The GN 2426 cam rollers are designed to ensure accurate and smooth motion across four contact points, with the exception of floating bearing rails, which only have two contact points. The rollers are also compatible with various types of sealing discs, including sheet metal profiles with gap seals (2Z). The cam rollers are available in nominal rail dimensions of h1 = 18, 28, 35, and 43 mm, with lengths up to 3600 mm in one piece or as combined rails for customized requirements. The rollers are suitable for use in a temperature range of -30 °C to 130 °C, and their load ratings vary depending on the rail version and load direction. For instance, the GN 2426-18-B-2RS roller has a load rating of 410 N, while the GN 2426-43-B-2RS roller has a load rating of 2700 N. The cam rollers are lubricated with a heavy-duty lubricant like Klüberplex BE 31-222, which should be applied periodically to maintain the lubricant film and ensure smooth operation. The GN 2426 cam rollers are designed to handle traversal speeds of up to 7 m/s, depending on the application and installation length. They are also suitable for use in various industrial settings where precise linear motion is critical. The rollers are packaged separately and supplied unssembled, with the open-end wrench GN 2424.1 included for assembly. The cam rollers are also compatible with other components such as cam roller linear guide rail systems and cam roller carriages, which can be fully pre-assembled upon request. Overall, the GN 2426 Cam Rollers are a robust and reliable solution for linear motion applications, offering high precision, durability, and ease of use.",Small Cast Iron Block Wheel V Belt Pulley,['Part_Number: Brake Products Brake Wheel 4 Inch'],Malik Building Materials Trading LLC,['ConstructionManufacturingMaterial Handling'],['building material supplypre-job planning servicesinstallation'],False,[None],"[{'quantity': 0, 'time_frame': None, 'type': None, 'unit': None}]","[{'amount': 0, 'currency': None, 'type': None}]",['Gray IronDuctile IronCarbon SteelStainless Steel'],[None],['CN'],-1,[None],"['Available in different configurations, including normal rollers with a centered bearing mounting point (Type N) and eccentric rollers with an eccentric bearing mounting point (Type E)']",['Carton boxesPlastic baggageCartonsWooden cratesPalletsContainers'],[None],"[{'dimension': 'Diameter', 'qualitative': False, 'type': 'min', 'unit': 'mm', 'value': '18'}

This process is achieved through a unique, 100% natural method that uses pure cold water and up to 87,000 psi (6,000 bar) of pressure to inactivate pathogenic and spoilage vegetative bacteria, yeasts, and molds. HPP is USDA/FSIS and FDA-approved, ensuring it meets stringent safety and quality standards. The technology is applicable to both organic and natural products, making it versatile for various food categories. The HPP process operates at pressure ranges between 58,000 psi and 87,000 psi, typically applied for durations from a few seconds to 5 minutes at refrigerated or room temperatures. Unlike traditional thermal pasteurization, HPP does not break or create covalent bonds, nor does it introduce new compounds through molecular degradation. This ensures that the natural qualities and enzymatic activity of the food are preserved, with refrigeration further minimizing residual microorganism growth and enzymatic changes. The shelf life of HPP processed beverages is typically increased by 3-10 times compared to products without HPP, stored at the same temperatures.

Maleic Anhydride is a key component in the production of paints, which are used to decorate, protect, and extend the life of natural and synthetic materials. These paints can be broadly classified into decorative paints, which are applied on-site to decorate and protect buildings and other objects, and industrial coatings, which are applied in factories to finish manufactured goods such as cars. The constituents of paints include pigments, binders (resins), extenders, solvents, and additives. Pigments are used to impart color and opacity, while binders, such as resin, form a matrix to hold the pigment in place. Extenders are larger pigment particles added to improve adhesion, strengthen the film, and save binder. Solvents, often referred to as thinners, are used to reduce the viscosity of the paint for better application. Additives are used to modify the properties of the liquid paint or dry film. The binder and solvent, sometimes known as the vehicle, may be dissolved as a solution or carried as a dispersion of microscopically small particles in a liquid. The most important binders in modern paints are acrylic polymers, alkylidene polymers, and epoxy polymers. Acrylic polymers are used in many emulsion paints, based on homopolymers or co-polymers of ethenyl ethanoate (vinyl acetate) and a propenoate (acrylic) ester. Ethenyl ethanoate is manufactured by passing a mixture of ethanoic acid vapor, ethene, and oxygen over heated palladium (II) and copper (II) chlorides. The polymers used in these paints are carried in water, making them better for the environment than paints in which the binders are in organic solvents. Emulsion paints are made by a process known as emulsion polymerization, in which the liquid monomers to be polymerized are first dispersed in water, forming polymers with relative molecular masses of 500000000. Acrylic resins may also be used in industrial paints, either as water-borne emulsion paints or as solvent-borne paints. Solvent-borne industrial paints can have a tough protective finish and are widely used in industry as topcoats, for example on car bodies. The paint frequently comes as two components, the main paint portion typically consisting of an acrylic resin produced by the polymerization of a propenoate ester formed from a polyhydric alcohol (diols and triols). The resulting polyester has numerous hydroxyl groups (-OH) pendant from the polymer backbone, which react with the other compound, often consisting of a polymeric isocyanate such as a trimer of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (hexamethylene diisocyanate). This reaction proceeds relatively slowly at room temperature, allowing enough time for the paint to be applied, after which the solvent thinner evaporates and the painted item is placed in an oven to accelerate the chemical reaction, greatly increasing the molecular mass of the polymer causing it to become a three-dimensional molecule and form a hard film, resistant to chemicals.",O-Dimethylaminocarbonyl-4-(6-dimethylamino-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-yl)benzaldehyde oxime,['Part_Number: JT-5797-03'],Western Chemical Industries P.

The compactor operates at a frequency of 98 Hz and has a displacement of 9.9 in³. It has an advance travel speed of 95 ft/min and a surface capacity of 8,062 ft²/h. The compactor is powered by an air-cooled, 4-cycle, single-cylinder, gasoline engine with a cyclone air filter, specifically the Honda GX160 engine, which delivers 4.15 hp at 3,600 rpm. The engine has a fuel consumption rate of 0.21 US gal/h and a fuel tank capacity of 0.95 US gal. The power transmission is from the engine via a centrifugal clutch and V-belt onto the exciter, which transmits centrifugal force onto the base plate. The compactor emits 757 CO2 (NRSC) per hour.

The product is priced at €14.65 per unit and is available in 50-gram jars. It is part of the Gold Set, which also includes Antique Gold, Rustic Gold, and Egyptian Bronze pigments. The pigment is intended for use with epoxy resin, where it can be mixed with gentle heat to create a beautiful gold float. For added effects, gold alcohol ink or isopropyl alcohol can be added to break apart the gold pigment and create cells. The recommended alcohol ink brand for this purpose is Rich Gold by Jacquard Pinata. Without resin, the pigment can be used to create gold lines with a paintbrush by mixing it with Pinata Rich Gold alcohol ink or gloss varnish. If the mixture evaporates or the pigment appears transparent, additional Rose Gold powder can be added.

This microscope features the newly developed Nikon Spatial Array Confocal (NSPARC) detector, which utilizes an ultra-low noise detector array to collect a two-dimensional image at each scanned point. This advanced imaging technology significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio by increasing the available signal level while allowing imaging with lower excitation power. The NSPARC detector's extremely low noise profile and high sensitivity make it ideal for demanding imaging conditions, including high-speed resonant imaging. The NSPARC noise profile shows extremely low standard deviation in pixel-to-pixel intensity, significantly lower than traditional GaAsP or PMT detectors. This results in high signal-to-noise ratio, sharper images, and superior resolution compared to standard GaAsP or PMT images. The NSPARC detector's array detection technology, comprising 25 detectors, allows for the collection of two-dimensional spatial information from each scanned pixel, enabling ultra-fine structural information to be reconstructed in the result image. This feature is particularly beneficial for live imaging applications, where ultra-short dwell times and the AX R resonant scanner enhance the collection of longer, less phototoxic imaging data. The NSPARC detector's single-photon detection sensitivity and array detection extend the capabilities of the AX system, revealing unseen details in every image and pushing the boundaries of resolution beyond theoretical limits. The AX / AX R with NSPARC Confocal Microscope is designed for high-speed imaging with improved sensitivity, making it perfect for applications requiring rapid image acquisition. With single photon detection sensitivity, the NSPARC detector's extremely low noise profile and exceptional sensitivity enable it to capture images at video frame rates, enabling image acquisition at high speeds. This makes it an ideal tool for live cell imaging timelapse, where the combination of ultra-short dwell times and the NSPARC's sensitivity allows for longer, less phototoxic imaging data to be collected. The microscope's ultra-large 25mm field of view (FOV) supports a wide selection of objectives capable of obtaining image data from large overviews down to extremely fine details. The built-in variable emission optics allow for the prioritization of enhanced optical sectioning or increased overall signal collection depending on specific experimental needs. This flexibility is further enhanced by the NSPARC's array detection, which provides spatial sampling of the confocal point spread function in every pixel, enabling enhanced resolution performance both laterally and axially. The microscope's ultra-large 25mm FOV and variable emission optics support a wide selection of compatible low and high magnification objectives, including silicon immersion objectives that minimize refractive index mismatches, improving overall system performance. The AX / AX R with NSPARC Confocal Microscope is also capable of fast image acquisition of large areas, with super-resolution images of large areas of 2048 x 2048 pixels being acquired at high speed (approximately 6 times faster than with a galvano scanner). This capability is particularly useful for capturing rapid changes in minute structures over large areas. The microscope's high-resolution capabilities are further demonstrated by its ability to create kymographs, which visualize the position of vessel endothelium over time, clearly displaying the pulsatory nature of the endothelial layer. Overall, the AX / AX R with NSPARC Confocal Microscope is a highly advanced imaging device that offers exceptional performance in various microscopy applications, including live cell imaging, high-speed imaging, and super-resolution imaging. Its ultra-low noise, high sensitivity detection, and array detection technology make it an ideal tool for researchers seeking to achieve superior imaging results in demanding conditions.",CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda D Series Objective,['SKU: RPLPL76548UPC: 812495029752'],"Chongqing Dontop Optics Co., Ltd.",['Home InspectionHVAC InspectionAutomotive InspectionGovernment Safety And Security InspectionsIndustrial InspectionAerospace Inspections'],['laboratory workresearch of multi-dimensional dynamic processes in living cellsin-vitro applicationscytologyclinical laboratoryhaematologypathology'],False,[None],"[{'quantity': 0, 'time_frame': None, 'type': None, 'unit': None}]","[{'amount': 0, 'currency': None, 'type': None}]",['Magnesium Alloy'],[None],['CN'],-1,['Custom-Built'],"['Capable of dissecting any kind of tissueSuitable for a wide variety of samplesIdeal for research fields such as neurology, cancer research, plant analysis, forensics, and climate researchUsed for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and next-generation sequencing researchIsolation of single cells, cell clusters, or subcellular structuresAbsolute identification of mutations within cellsGene expression profilingIdentification of cell proteins during physiological events']",['PolybagsInner boxesCartons'],[None],"[{'dimension': 'Diameter', 'qualitative': False, 'type': 'exact', 'unit': 'mm', 'value': '17'}

This yarn is categorized as fingering weight, making it ideal for delicate and intricate knitting projects. Each skein is meticulously hand-dyed, ensuring that no two skeins are exactly alike, even if they are of the same color. The yarn is available in a gross weight of 400 meters (100 grams) and is recommended to be used with needles sized between 2.5mm and 3.75mm (US 3 to 5). The recommended needle size varies slightly depending on the specific project requirements. The yarn is hand-dyed and tends to vary slightly between and within dye lots due to the nature of the dying process. After each skein is dyed and cooled to room temperature, it is gently rinsed in cold water to remove any excess dye and soaked in natural soap to begin the spinning and drying process. This meticulous care ensures that the yarn is of the highest quality before it is shipped. The regular price of the OOAK - BFL Yarn is €20.00, with a sale price of €6.67 per unit, inclusive of tax. Shipping costs are calculated at checkout. The yarn is sold out at the moment, and customers can opt to receive the yarn in a ball (cake) by leaving a message in their order. Payment options include PayPal and other methods.
